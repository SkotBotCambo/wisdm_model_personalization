    "Uses an uncertainty sampling technique which looks at a pool of candidates and asks for a label for the *n* samples it is least confident in its prediction for.  While this technique allows for better control over the number of samples we allow it to query for, it also requires that we look at an entire pool of examples first instead of one by one as they are sampled. If the query needs to happen as the sample occurs, such as is likely necessary with activity recognition or most applications of context-aware computing, then this technique will need to be modified. We have a few ideas of how that can be done :\n",
