# ToDo for the repository
* Add full description
* add python script to create the data directories within the local repo directory, download the data, fix the arff's
* add a results directory
  * possibly also add computed results to an s3 bucket and pull these results into the directory with another python script for pre-populating the results directory for those that just want to analyze the outcome
* Add a summary notebook when analysis is finalized-ish
