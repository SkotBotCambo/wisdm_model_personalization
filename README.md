# wisdm_model_personalization

# ToDo for the repository
* Add full description
* ~~add python script to create the data directories within the local repo directory, download the data, fix the arff's~~
* ~~add a results directory~~
  * possibly also add computed results to an s3 bucket and pull these results into the directory with another python script for pre-populating the results directory for those that just want to analyze the outcome
* Add a summary notebook when analysis is finalized-ish
* modify helpers to easily switch between v1.1 dataset and v2.0 dataset so that experiments can be run which train on one and test on the other.
